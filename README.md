### Unsupervised Machine Learning

Martha will pitch an investment in cryptocurrencies to her firm Accountability Accounting. Martha has a dataset of cryptocurrencies and can analyze it in anyway she wants. My job is to help Marth to discover trends that will convince her firm to invest in these new currencies. Lucky for both of us this is the perfect job for Unsupervised Machine Learning.

Supervised learning is fairly simple: We use it when we know what we're looking for or what our output should be. Two of the most popular techniques are classification and regression. For example, if we want to see how Bitcoin performs over time, or if we want to figure out what kinds of coins a user is most likely to buy, we use supervised learning. However, we use unsupervised learning when we don't yet know the question we're asking of the data. In other words, we just want to figure out if there is anything at all the data can tell us.

Now that we understand what Unsupervised Machine Learning is for we are creating a report that includes what what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.
