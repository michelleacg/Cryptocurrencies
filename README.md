### Unsupervised Machine Learning

Martha will pitch an investment in cryptocurrencies to her firm Accountability Accounting. Martha has a dataset of cryptocurrencies and can analyze it in anyway she wants. My job is to help Marth to discover trends that will convince her firm to invest in these new currencies. Lucky for both of us this is the perfect job for Unsupervised Machine Learning.
